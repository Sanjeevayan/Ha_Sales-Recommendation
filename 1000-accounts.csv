They also own HEAT Self Service but it is currently not installed
The modules from HEAT they use are:
Call Logging
HEAT Messaging Center
Bus. Process Automation Module
Crystal Enterprise handles their reporting capability

The company's stereolithography apparatuses (SLAs) and other machines create 3-D prototypes of everything from toys to airplane parts. Its SLAs rapidly produce 3-D objects designed in CAD/CAM software in a process called solid imaging, which uses a laser to sculpt plastic resin materials into physical models. Its ThermoJet solid object printer also fabricates plastic models using a modified ink jet printing system. Additionally, 3D Systems sells the raw plastic and metal consumable material used in its machinery. Customers have included General Electric, Hasbro, and Texas Instruments.
